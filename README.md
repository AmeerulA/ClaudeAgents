# Custom AI Agents

This project contains custom-built AI agents designed for my specific needs and use cases.

## Philosophy

The agents in this repository are built with a unique approach:

- **Process Control**: Agents are designed to control their own process and workflows
- **Minimal Limitations**: Technical capabilities are intentionally kept unrestricted to allow maximum flexibility and autonomy
- **Custom Solutions**: Each agent is tailored to address specific requirements and scenarios

## Structure

- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations and implementations
- `reference/` - Reference materials and documentation for agent development

## Available Agents

### forge-critic
Expert code reviewer specializing in rigorous, evidence-based pull request analysis. Conducts comprehensive reviews following strict git operations workflow, analyzing changes for logic correctness, security, performance, and code quality with precise file references and actionable recommendations.

### mastermind
Technical architect and project planner that creates detailed, actionable implementation plans for complex features and refactoring efforts. Breaks down large tasks into manageable steps with clear dependencies, risk assessment, and realistic effort estimation.

### truth-seeker
Pure investigative analyst focused exclusively on gathering evidence and documenting facts about code and systems. Conducts exhaustive investigations without making recommendations or writing code, ensuring absolute accuracy in findings.

## Purpose

These agents serve as specialized tools that can operate with a high degree of autonomy, making decisions and managing their own execution flow without artificial constraints on their technical abilities.
