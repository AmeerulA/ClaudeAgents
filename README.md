# Custom AI Agents

This project contains custom-built AI agents designed for my specific needs and use cases.

## Philosophy

The agents in this repository are built with a unique approach:

- **Process Control**: Agents are designed to control their own process and workflows
- **Minimal Limitations**: Technical capabilities are intentionally kept unrestricted to allow maximum flexibility and autonomy
- **Custom Solutions**: Each agent is tailored to address specific requirements and scenarios

## Structure

- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations and implementations
- `reference/` - Reference materials and documentation for agent development

## Purpose

These agents serve as specialized tools that can operate with a high degree of autonomy, making decisions and managing their own execution flow without artificial constraints on their technical abilities.
